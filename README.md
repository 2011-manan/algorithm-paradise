Welcome to an algorithm paradise, a fun way to share and display your knowledge of basic to advanced algorithms while learning to use GitHub.

1. This repository will be used in the workshop "Hacktoberfest in Chandigarh - Open Hack Day"
2. Attendees of the workshop will forst be shown a method by which you can submit a pull request to this repo.
3. Then attendees will be sending PRs of their own.
4. This will be an attempt to allow newcomers to start towards contributing towards open source and also allow them to demonstrate their own algorithm code abilites to everyone else.

disclaimer:
This is in no means a dummy repository for the sole purpose of allowing multiple PRs, this will only be a 1-2 PR per person repo only because we don't want people to expoilt this repo in an attempt to acheive all their hacktoberfest goals.
So for this purpose: **All PRs or Issues found to be disobeying this condition will be marked invalid**
